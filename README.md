Power BI Dashboard

I recently built a comprehensive Hospital Management Dashboard in Power BI, designed to provide clear, actionable insights across key operational areas — Patients, Doctors, Finance, Medicines, and Hospital Infrastructure.

This dashboard helps healthcare teams make data-driven decisions with ease and speed. 💡

🔍 Key Highlights of the Dashboard:

📌 Interactive Overview Page – Shows patient trends, doctor availability, medicine stock, bed status & more.
 👩‍⚕️ Patient Insights – Personal details, diagnosis, medicine consumption pattern, charges, and recovery summary.
 👨‍⚕️ Doctor Dashboard – Appointments, salary insights, commission calculator, patient feedback & ratings.
 🏥 Hospital Information – Test status, age-wise patient distribution, bed occupancy & surgery timelines.
 💰 Finance Dashboard – Revenue, expenses, stock purchases, staff salary analysis & supplier performance.

🛠️ Techniques & Processes Used:

✔Advanced Visualization Techniques : KPI Cards, Slicers & Tooltips
✔UI/UX Enhancements 🎨: Custom Icons & 3D Illustrations, Shadows
